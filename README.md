# ImagiNet: A Balanced High-Resolution Dataset for Benchmarking of Synthetic Image Detectors
![](media/dataset_preview.png)
**Abstract:**
<p align="justify">Generative models, such as Diffusion Models (DMs), Variational    Auto-Encoders (VAEs), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),    produce images with a level of authenticity that makes them nearly    indistinguishable from real photos and artwork. While this capability    is beneficial for many industries, the difficulty of identifying    synthetic images leaves online media platforms vulnerable to    impersonation and misinformation attempts. To support the development    of defensive methods, we introduce ImagiNet, a high-resolution and    balanced dataset for synthetic image detection. It contains 200K    examples, spanning four content categories: photos, paintings, faces,    and uncategorized. Synthetic images are produced with open-source and    proprietary generators, whereas real counterparts of the same content    type are collected from public datasets. The structure of ImagiNet    allows for a two-track evaluation system: i) classification as real    or synthetic and ii) identification of the generative model. To    establish a baseline, we train a ResNet-50 model using a    self-supervised contrastive (SelfCon) objective for each track. The    model demonstrates strong performance across previously available    benchmarks, achieving an AUC of up to 0.97 and balanced accuracy    ranging between 80% and 93%, even under social network conditions    involving compression and resizing. </p>
